fix: update API paths to use direct Netlify Functions format

- Change all API calls from /api/* to /.netlify/functions/* format
- Fix the upvote feature by ensuring correct API endpoints
- Update paths in story client components and fetcher
- This resolves the 500 error when clicking the upvote button

Although there's a redirect rule in netlify.toml, using the direct
path format ensures consistent behavior across all environments.
