fix: improve Netlify Identity widget initialization and error handling

- Add proper initialization of Netlify Identity widget with site URL
- Fix authentication flow with improved event handling
- Add extensive debugging information to diagnose identity issues
- Update identity modal with clearer loading states and error messages
- Add fallback for localhost development

This should fix the issue where the authentication modal gets stuck in loading.
