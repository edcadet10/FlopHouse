fix: remove TypeScript directive and improve client-only component

- Completely remove `@ts-expect-error` directive that was causing build failure
- Enhance ClientOnly component with proper client-side detection
- Implement the React standard pattern for avoiding server-side rendering
- Fix Netlify build issues with TypeScript errors

This properly handles the Next.js server/client component boundary.
