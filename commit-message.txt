feat: implement Netlify Identity for upvoting

- Add identity-modal component for seamless authentication
- Update upvote-story.js to verify JWT tokens and record unique user IDs
- Modify client components to handle authentication flow
- Track unique upvoters instead of just incrementing a counter
- Add documentation for the implementation

This change improves data quality by preventing duplicate upvotes
and enhances the user experience with a streamlined magic link
authentication flow.
