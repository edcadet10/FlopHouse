We built a great product that developers loved, but our business model couldn't sustain growth.

## The Product

CodeBuddy was an AI-powered code review tool that integrated with GitHub and provided real-time feedback on code quality, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

## The Problem

Developers loved our free tier, but we struggled to convert them to paying customers. Our pricing model didn't align with the value we provided.

## Lessons Learned

1. Validate willingness to pay early on
2. Build a business model that aligns with user value
3. Focus on enterprise sales earlier
