A deep dive into how we misunderstood the market need and built features nobody wanted.

## The Beginning

We started TaskMaster with a simple mission: help teams manage tasks better. We raised a $1.2M seed round and assembled a team of 6 engineers.

## Where We Went Wrong

We built features we thought users would want, without validating our assumptions. We spent 8 months building an AI-powered task prioritization system, only to find out most users just wanted simple kanban boards.

## Lessons Learned

1. Talk to users before building features
2. Launch with a minimal viable product
3. Focus on solving one problem really well
