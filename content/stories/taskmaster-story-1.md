TaskMaster started as a solution to a problem I had personally experienced: task management tools were either too simplistic or too complex. Our vision was to create the perfect middle ground - a tool sophisticated enough for power users but simple enough for everyday productivity enthusiasts.

We raised $1.2M in seed funding after six months of bootstrapping, which felt like validation of our idea. The team was excited, investors were enthusiastic, and early users seemed to love our beta.

The first signs of trouble appeared when we started measuring user retention. People would sign up, create a few tasks, and then never return. Our initial explanation was that we just needed more features, so we doubled down on development.

After a year of adding requested features, our retention barely improved. The breakthrough moment came during customer interviews when we realized our users didn't actually have a significant problem with existing tools - they were just curious about ours. We were building a nice-to-have, not a must-have.

By the time we attempted to pivot toward enterprise with features teams truly needed, we had burned through most of our funding. Our last three months were spent trying to secure additional investment, but without strong metrics, investors passed.

We officially closed our doors in April 2025, 18 months after raising our seed round.

## Lessons Learned

1. Validate the market pain point with real money before building. We had enthusiastic users but not paying customers.

2. Talking to users is essential, but understanding what they actually DO versus what they SAY is critical.

3. Be careful of vanity metrics. Our user growth looked promising, but retention told the real story.

4. Being "better" isn't enough - you need to be significantly better or different in a way that solves a real pain point.

5. Funding can mask problems and create false confidence. We should have been more capital efficient until we had product-market fit.</content>
