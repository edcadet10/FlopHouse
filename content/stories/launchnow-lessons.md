Our no-code platform gained early traction but failed to convert free users to paying customers.

## The Vision

LaunchNow was a no-code platform designed to help non-technical founders build MVPs without writing a single line of code.

## What Happened

We entered a crowded market too late, competing with established players like Bubble and Webflow. Our differentiators weren't strong enough to convince users to switch.

## Key Takeaways

1. Market timing is crucial - being first mover or having a strong differentiation
2. Free users don't always convert, even if they love your product
3. Listen to the market before building complex features
