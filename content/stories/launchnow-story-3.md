LaunchNow began with a compelling vision: empowering non-technical founders to build and launch their MVPs without writing a single line of code. The no-code movement was gaining momentum, and we saw an opportunity to create a platform specifically tailored for startup founders.

Our journey started promisingly. We raised a $2.5M seed round from well-known VCs who believed in the no-code future. Our beta launch attracted over 10,000 sign-ups in the first month, and users were building impressive prototypes on our platform.

The growth metrics looked fantastic - user signups grew 30% month-over-month for the first six months, and we were featured in major tech publications. Our team expanded from 3 to 15 people to keep up with development demands and user support.

However, beneath the surface, concerning patterns emerged. While many users started building projects, only about 20% completed them. Of those who completed projects, only a small fraction converted from our generous free tier to paid plans. Our unit economics didn't make sense - the CAC was 4x higher than our LTV.

We initially blamed our pricing, so we experimented with different models. We tried usage-based pricing, seat-based pricing, and even outcome-based pricing. Nothing moved the needle significantly. The harsh reality was that most founders used our platform to build an MVP, then either abandoned the idea or migrated to more robust development tools once they gained traction.

We were essentially subsidizing the earliest stage of many startups without capturing value when they succeeded. By the time we realized this fundamental flaw in our model, we had burned through most of our funding. Our attempts to raise a Series A with underwhelming conversion metrics failed.

After 18 months of operation, we made the difficult decision to shut down LaunchNow. We managed to sell some of our technology to a larger no-code platform, which provided a small return to our investors.

## Lessons Learned

1. Beware of vanity metrics. High signup rates and user growth masked our fundamental business model issues.

2. Understand your place in the customer journey. We were a stepping stone, not a long-term solution for most of our users.

3. Be cautious about building in highly commoditized spaces. The no-code market quickly became crowded with well-funded competitors.

4. Test your revenue model early. We waited too long to validate whether users would pay for our service.

5. Cash flow is king. We scaled our team based on user growth before proving revenue, which accelerated our runway depletion.

6. Build a moat. Our platform was useful but lacked defensibility, making it easy for users to switch to alternatives.</content>
