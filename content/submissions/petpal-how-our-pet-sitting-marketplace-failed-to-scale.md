# The Rise and Fall of PetPal

In 2023, we launched PetPal with a simple mission: to connect pet owners with trusted pet sitters in their neighborhood. The idea came to me after struggling to find reliable care for my dog Luna during a business trip. Traditional kennels were expensive and impersonal, while asking friends felt like an imposition. I figured there must be a better way—a platform where pet owners could connect with vetted, affordable sitters nearby.

## The Vision and Early Days

PetPal started as a two-sided marketplace where pet owners could browse sitter profiles, check reviews, and book services like dog walking, overnight stays, and drop-in visits. Sitters could set their own rates, and we'd take a 15% commission on each transaction.

We bootstrapped for six months, building an MVP and testing it with a small group of users in San Francisco. The feedback was encouraging: pet owners loved the convenience, and sitters appreciated the extra income. This early traction helped us secure a $750K seed round from Angel Pet Ventures and two smaller VCs.

## What Went Right

Our initial user acquisition strategy worked well. We partnered with local pet stores, veterinarians, and animal shelters to spread the word. We also ran targeted social media campaigns that resulted in decent conversion rates. Within eight months, we had 1,200 registered users (800 pet owners and 400 sitters) across three cities.

Customer satisfaction was high, with an average rating of 4.8/5 stars. Many users became repeat customers, and word-of-mouth referrals grew steadily. Our tech stack was solid—a React Native app with a Node.js backend that handled bookings, payments, and messaging smoothly.

## Where Things Started to Break

Despite the positive signals, we started noticing troubling patterns in our unit economics. The average transaction value was lower than expected ($35), and user frequency was inconsistent. Many pet owners only needed services a few times a year, unlike daily services like food delivery or ridesharing.

Our CAC was $45, which initially seemed acceptable. However, the lifetime value of customers wasn't high enough to justify this expense. We were paying to acquire users who might only generate $100-200 in revenue (meaning $15-30 in commission for us) before churning.

Insurance was another major challenge. To provide the safety assurances pet owners wanted, we needed to offer liability coverage, which significantly ate into our margins. This wasn't something we had fully accounted for in our initial projections.

## The Breaking Point

Nine months after launching, we were burning through our funding faster than anticipated. Our runway was shrinking, and our growth metrics weren't strong enough to secure a Series A. We tried several strategies to improve our unit economics:

1. Raising our commission to 20% - This caused sitter churn, as many preferred to take their regular clients off-platform
2. Adding premium features for pet owners - Limited uptake, as most were price-sensitive
3. Introducing a subscription model - This improved revenue somewhat but reduced overall user growth

Despite these efforts, we couldn't make the numbers work. Our costs remained too high, and our revenue too low. We had a product people liked but couldn't build a sustainable business around it.

## The End

Fifteen months after launch, with two months of runway left, we made the difficult decision to shut down PetPal. We had served over 3,000 pets and facilitated more than 12,000 bookings, but our business model simply wasn't viable in the long run.

We gave our users a month's notice, helped sitters connect directly with their regular clients, and refunded all outstanding payments. The team scattered to other startups, and I spent several months reflecting on what we could have done differently.

## Lessons Learned

## Lessons Learned

1. **Validate unit economics early.** We were too focused on user growth and product features without ensuring our fundamental business model worked. We should have run more financial simulations with realistic customer lifetime values before scaling.

2. **Frequency matters in marketplaces.** Unlike daily-use platforms, our occasional-use service faced built-in limitations on revenue per user. In retrospect, we should have either focused on high-value transactions or found ways to increase usage frequency.

3. **Hidden costs can sink you.** Insurance and trust/safety features weren't just nice-to-haves but essential components that significantly impacted our margins. These should have been factored into our initial plans.

4. **Beware of disintermediation.** In high-trust services like pet sitting, once a relationship is established, there's a strong incentive for both parties to take transactions off-platform. We needed stronger retention mechanisms.

5. **Raising money isn't validation.** Our seed round gave us a false sense of security. Money in the bank doesn't mean you have a viable business model.

Would I do it again? Yes, but differently. The pet care market is still underserved by technology, but any solution needs to address the fundamental frequency and unit economics challenges we faced. Perhaps combining pet sitting with other recurring pet services would create a more sustainable model.
